Update of https://github.com/squeeb/JUNO-106-M4L/blob/main/README.md correction on Pubo's 106 max4live patch.
I added change to every slider object in order to filter data sent as the amount of message sent was creating a bottleneck.

I also added my version of it, you can use all the sliders of your juno 106 in real time, it's missing from now a way to use switch and buttons from the 106 interface, i'll try to make it work asap.
The buttons are in reverse order, as it's theirs binary logicac order.
There's also a 106 user's manual.
